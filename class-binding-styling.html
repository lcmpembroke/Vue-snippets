                include the notActive class if the isActive property is false
    Note that if isActive is false, then the active class won't be applied (and it would've been black color as static class not defined
        however, the second bit after the comma means notActive class is applied if the isActive is set to false

        Notice the single quotes, i think both work the same------not sure which is best practice.
